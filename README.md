# Boki - Book Sorter
Simple book sorter for `.epub`, `.pdf`, and `azw3`. It's not advanced, and it won't get everything perfect.

The `.epub` sorter works the best due to it using the `ebooklib` module, thus we can read the title and author with ease.
Remaining file types will go by title name, it will try it's best to sort them but it will sometimes mess it up by having the title as the author and the book as the title.

I'll keep working on the file if I deem it necessary.

Specify where your books are located, it will go inside each directory inside the specified directory to look for books. Afterwards specify where you would like your sorted books to be stored, wait until it's over.
